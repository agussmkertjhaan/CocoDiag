        Indonesia has a tropical climate ideal for coconut production and is the second-largest coconut producer and exporter in the world, making it a promising export opportunity. To ensure the high quality of coconut products, it is crucial to prevent and treat diseases that affect coconut plants. These diseases can cause losses of up to 30%, highlighting the importance of taking measures to protect the plants.
        To reduce the losses caused by coconut plant diseases, it is essential to quickly detect and address these diseases in a way that is easily manageable for every farmer. An automated coconut plant disease detection application is needed to assist farmers in this effort. This application will enable farmers to detect diseases from anywhere, especially those without a specialized educational background in coconut plants.
        Research on coconut plant disease detection already exists, and the development of applications for detecting plant diseases has also been done. However, there is no commercially available application for coconut disease detection that is accessible to the general public. Additionally, the existing applications are limited to disease detection only. This shortcoming has prompted us to develop an application that can automatically detect coconut plant diseases, provide treatment recommendations, and include a community feature, allowing farmers to share knowledge with other users/farmers regarding coconut plant care.
